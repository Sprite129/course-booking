# Course Booking
This is my pet project which I write in my free time to practice **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

## Status
In progress...

## Design
I will be using my old **figma design** as an *approximate* reference. Some features will be changed as I made this design when I had less experience with frontend development

## About
This project is a **mock** course booking website with several features such as:
- Carousel
- Dynamic reviews loading (from `json-server`)
- Course booking calendar (with display of available and sold out courses)

I may also add registration and login feature but for now I want to concentrate on my basic design and improve it.

## Plans
- [x] Write basic HTML  
- [x] Update GitHub as I go  
- [ ] Write CSS  
- [ ] Write JS  
- [ ] Test the system
- [ ] Refine imperfections
- [ ] Add registration as a separate branch  
- [ ] Test registration  
- [ ] Merge and finish

## Technologies used
- **HTML5** – structure of the website  
- **CSS3** – styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – logic and interactivity  
- **[JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)** – mock backend
- **Figma** – design reference
